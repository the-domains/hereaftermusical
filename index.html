A Preview of "Waiting" From The Snapple Press Event
 
"Waiting" from Hereafter Musical press event featuring the entire company at the Snapple Theater on Thursday, September 11th. The cast is not in costume but the staging and their performance more than makes up for that.
 

 
Snapple Theater Press Photo
 
Here's a powerful image from the show. It was taken by CBS photographer Jeff Staab. Again the cast is not in costume but it doesn't detract from the beauty.  He has been shooting our show for many years and he never ceases to amaze us with his eye and composition.
 

 
After Hereafter
 
The entire cast along with family and friends gathered at Emmett O'lunney's downstairs for an impromptu after party (something that I think will be a regular occurrence). It was great to see Debbie's family meet with the cast after seeing the show for the very first time. </p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 data-reactid="26"><a data-reactid="27">Hereafter Musical</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="31"></div></section></div></div>
